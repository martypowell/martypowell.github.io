        <title>Run Army Sister</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Run Army Sister is a small blog that I worked on for one of my friend’s, wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with Karen to design a blog with an Army feel.  The purpose of this blog is to track and share Karen’s running experiences as well as raise money for the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Vist the homepage of the Wounded Warrior Project&quot;&gt;Wounded Warrior Project&lt;/a&gt;.  The site also shows Karen’s progress towards her donation goals as well as upcoming races and results.  The site responds well to any device and contains a photo gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project I worked as the designer and developer.  Wordpress proved to be the right tool for this site. It provided the functionality we needed to keep this site clean &amp;amp; simple.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Peninsula Skating Rink</title>
        <description>The Peninsula Skating Rink is a small website that provides information about a local outdoor skating rink in Blue Hill, Maine.

I worked with my brother in law to create a basic site that contains rink information and a photo gallery.  This site is going to be moved to Wordpress in the near future.  The update will allow the customer to update all of their content and give them the ability change the status of the rink from open to closed on the home page.

For this project I worked as the designer and developer. Some of the design elements were provided by my awesome co-worker &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/samdurphy&quot; title=&quot;Visit Sam on LinkedIn&quot;&gt;Sam Durphy&lt;/a&gt;.

Run Army Sister is a small blog that I worked on for one of my friend's, wife.

I worked with Karen to design a blog with an Army feel.  The purpose of this blog is to track and share Karen's running experiences as well as raise money for the <a href="" title="Vist the homepage of the Wounded Warrior Project">Wounded Warrior Project</a>.  The site also shows Karen's progress towards her donation goals as well as upcoming races and results.  The site responds well to any device and contains a photo gallery.

For this project I worked as the designer and developer.  Wordpress proved to be the right tool for this site. It provided the functionality we needed to keep this site clean &amp; simple.
